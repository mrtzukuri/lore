                "text": "\nDESCRIPTION\n\nClosures, prototypes, JSON, the DOM, selectors, inheritance in CSS and in Javascript, and first class functions - that's what this course is about.\nThis is\u00a0not\u00a0a course on Javascript frameworks - its about solid, fundamental HTML, CSS and Javascript. You'll be surprised by how much more you can get done on your web pages once you learn these technologies\u00a0the right way.\nWhat do we mean by that?\n\nRelatively few folks formally learn HTML, CSS or Javascript, because its quite easy to get stuff done in these technologies in a \"quick-and-dirty way\".\nThat \"quick-and-dirty\" way of learning and doing leads to problems over time, because Javascript and CSS are actually quite complex, so it is easy to do things the wrong way\nThis course will help, because it has 75 examples, 20 in HTML/CSS and 55 in Javascript. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a simple, specific use-case. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.\n\nWhat's Included:\n\nBasic HTML:\u00a0Folks stopped counting HTML as a language worth formally learning sometime in the 90s, but this is only partially justified. It always helps to have strong basics.\nCSS:\u00a0Cascading Stylesheets are incredibly powerful, and incredibly hard to use - until you know how they really work. Once you understand inheritance and selection in CSS, it will all make a lot more sense.\nJavascript\u00a0is a full-fledged, powerful and complicated language. Its really important to learn Javascript formally, because it is just so different from most other languages you would have encountered. For instance - Javascript has objects and inheritance but no classes.\nClosures\u00a0in Javascript are a rather mind-bending concept - functions that \"remember\" how the world looked when they were created.\nPrototypes\u00a0are Javascript's way of doing inheritance, and its very different from the C++/Java way of doing it.\nJSON\u00a0is not conceptually difficult to use, but it is incredibly important, and you should understand why - because its the glue between backends written in Java or other traditional languages, and front-ends written in Javascript\nThe Document-Object-Model\u00a0is what ties Javascript back to HTML and CSS. Together with JSON, the DOM ties it all together from server to skin.\n\nUsing discussion forums\nPlease use the discussion forums on this course to engage with other students and to help each other out. Unfortunately, much as we would like to, it is not possible for us at Loonycorn to respond to individual questions from students:-(\nWe're super small and self-funded with only 2\u00a0people developing technical video content.\u00a0Our mission is to make high-quality courses available at super low prices.\nThe only way to keep our prices this low is to\u00a0*NOT offer additional technical support over email or in-person*. The truth is, direct support is hugely expensive and just does not scale.\nWe understand that this is not ideal and that a lot of students might benefit from this additional support. Hiring resources for additional support would make our offering much more expensive, thus defeating our original purpose.\nIt is a hard trade-off.\nThank you for your patience and understanding!\nWho is the target audience?\n\nYep! Folks who are absolutely new to web programming, and wish to learn HTML and CSS from scratch\nYep! Folks who are seeking to learn Javascript the right way - including folks who may done some Javascript programming, but are not quite confident using advanced features such as closures or dynamic prototyping\nYep! Java, C#, Python or C++ programmers who are looking to master Javascript\nNope! This class is not right for you if you are looking to learn Javascript frameworks such as JQuery, Angular or Node.js\n\n\n\n\n\nBASIC KNOWLEDGE\n\n\nAny modern browser and a simple text editor are all that will be needed for the code examples\nSome prior programming experience will definitely help in the advanced Javascript portions - if you are entirely new to programming, the second half of the Javascript section will seem very challenging\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN\n\n\nUnderstand HTML - its structure, and the commonly used tags\nUtilise CSS, including inheritance, selectors, the box model - the very topics that make CSS hard to use\nMaster the fundamentals of Javascript\nUse closures, dynamic prototyping, JSON, and the Document-Object-Model with confidence\n\n\nContact Us:SimplivEmail: support@simpliv.comPhone: 7676008458Email: sudheer@simpliv.comPhone:\u00a0\n9036771917\nTo Enroll Click Here\n\n\n",
